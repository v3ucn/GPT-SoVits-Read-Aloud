Read Aloud allows you to select from a variety of text-to-speech voices, including those provided natively by the browser, as well as by text-to-speech cloud service providers such as Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft.

## About

Read Aloud is aimed at users who prefer to listen to content instead of reading, people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities, children learning to read, learning foreign language or simply to provide users with alternative way to consume web content.

Read Aloud is an open-source project I created in my spare time to satisfy my own need. I'm surprised that it has become quite popular and glad that it's been useful to many people. If you wish to contribute bug fixes or translations, please visit the GitHub page (https://github.com/ken107/read-aloud). If you see bugs or have suggestions to make the extension better, please don't hesitate to provide feedback via the "report issue" link inside the app.
